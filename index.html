	<h1>Integrating Perspectives on Discourse Annotation</h1>
	      
	<p>Reflecting the growing interest in analyzing language
beyond the sentence level in theoretical and computational
linguistics, psycholinguistics, and applied domains, this workshop
aims at bringing together researchers from the various subdisciplines
that are working on aspects of discourse annotation. 

Advances in formal pragmatics are extending the empirical reach of
linguistic analyses, and in computational linguistics interest in
applications such as dialogue systems and argumentation mining is
connecting to early research on dialogue structure and Rhetorical
Structure Theory, and multi-layer corpus annotation efforts such as
NXT Switchboard or the Penn Discourse Treebank.


On the content
side this includes, for example, research on i) the annotation of
discourse relations (including argumentation mining), ii) the
annotation of information structural concepts (topic, focus, ...) ,
and iii) the analysis and annotation of Questions under Discussion.
We also aim to bring together different annotation methods, such as i)
manual annotation (e.g., work focusing on the evaluation of
annotations schemes and the reliability of the annotation in from of
agreement values), ii) crowdsourcing annotation, potentially
supporting the annotation of some aspects for larger data sets, and
iii) the automatic labelling of discourse information.

The workshop should thus provide an overview on the current
state-of-the-art in the field of discourse annotation and foster the
interaction and cooperation of researchers working in different
frameworks and using different annotations methods. 
</p>

	<p>The past years have seen a growing interest in analyzing language
beyond the sentence level, in theoretical linguistics, computational
linguistics, as well as in psycho-linguistics.  The developments are
driven by a range of factors, from increased interest in authentic
language use in context to theoretical and practical motivations for
the integration of top-down and bottom-up analysis.
