	<h1>Integrating Perspectives on Discourse Annotation</h1>
	<h3>Workshop Description</h3>
     
	      
	<p>The past years have seen a growing interest in analyzing language
beyond the sentence level, in theoretical linguistics, computational
linguistics, as well as in psycho-linguistics.  The developments are
driven by a range of factors, from increased interest in authentic
language use in context to theoretical and practical motivations for
the integration of top-down and bottom-up analysis. In theoretical
linguistics, advances in formal pragmatics are extending the reach of
formal linguistic analysis, and in computational linguistics interest
in applications such as dialogue systems and argumentation mining can
connect to early research on dialogue structure and Rhetorical
Structure Theory, and multi-layer corpus annotation efforts such as
NXT Switchboard or the Penn Discourse Treebank.
</p>
		

	<p>In this workshop, we want to bring together researchers from  various
subdisciplines that are working on a range of aspects of discourse annotation. On
the one hand, we plan to particularly encourage presentation of
research combining and comparing different aspects of discourse annotation,
including i) the annotation of discourse relations (including
argumentation mining), ii) the annotation of information structural
concepts and iii)
research in the newly emerging field of QUD annotation.
On the other, we would also like to include research on different
annotation methods in our workshop, such as i) manual annotation,
(focusing on the evaluation of annotations schemes and the
reliability of the annotation in from of agreement values),
ii) crowdsourcing annotation, also a form of manual annotation, but not by
experts, but untrained crowd workers, therefore enabling the
annotation of larger resources, and finally iii) the automatic labelling of
discourse information, an enterprise that is increasing in relevance,
but for many types of annotation schemes, compared to manual
annotations, it is still difficult to obtain comparable reliability.

The workshop should thus provide an overview on the current
state-of-the-art in the field of discourse annotation and foster the
interaction and cooperation of researchers working in different
frameworks and using different annotations methods.
