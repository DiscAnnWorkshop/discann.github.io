                           Call for Papers
                       for the ESSLLI Workshop

           Integrating Perspectives on Discourse Annotation
                  https://discannworkshop.github.io

                to be held August 3-7, 2020 in Utrecht
                  Paper submission deadline: March 1


Reflecting the  substantial interest in analyzing  language beyond the
sentence    level   in    linguistics,   computational    linguistics,
psycholinguistics, and applied domains, this workshop aims at bringing
together researchers from the  various subdisciplines that are working
on aspects of discourse annotation.  Advances in formal pragmatics are
extending the  empirical reach  of linguistic  analyses. Computational
linguistic research  on dialogue and discourse  structure has produced
multi-layer corpus annotation  efforts such as NXT  Switchboard or the
Penn  Discourse Treebank.  Applications include  dialogue systems  and
argumentation mining.

This  workshop  is  designed  as  a  joint  forum  for  the  range  of
perspectives on  discourse feeding and complementing  each other. This
includes research on the analysis and annotation of

- discourse relations, be it related  to frameworks such as RST, SDRT,
  or applications such as argumentation mining, and

- information structural  concepts (Topic/Focus,  Givenness, Questions
  under Discussion).

Equally  of  interest  are   methodological  issues  related  to  such
annotation, such as reflections on

- manual  annotation, e.g.,  evaluating  annotations  schemes and  the
  reliability of the annotation,

- crowdsourcing annotation,  potentially supporting the  annotation of
  some aspects for larger data sets, and

- the automatic labelling using computational approaches.

Relatedly,  we  are interested  in  a  discussion  of the  sources  of
evidence that different annotation schemes and annotation methods rely
on.  Where  are  annotations  based  on  linguistic  forms  (bottom-up
observable  in the  language  data)  and where  are  they grounded  in
discourse properties (top-down, from context or task)?

The workshop is designed to  foster the interaction and cooperation of
researchers  working  in  different  frameworks  and  using  different
annotations methods  and document the current  state-of-the-art in the
field of discourse annotation.  


Submissions: 

We  invite papers  of 4  pages (plus  unlimited references)  using the
short paper ACL  2020 style templates available for LaTeX  and Word at
http://acl2020.org/downloads/acl2020-templates.zip  or on  Overleaf at
https://overleaf.com/latex/templates/acl-2020-proceedings-template/zsrkcwjptpcd

Based on the workshop theme, topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:

- the analysis and annotation of discourse relations, be it related to
  frameworks such as RST, SDRT,  or applications such as argumentation
  mining

- the  analysis  and  annotation of  information  structural  concepts
  (Topic/Focus, Givenness, Questions under Discussion)

- methodological issues, such as  reflections on i) manual annotation,
  e.g.,  evaluating annotations  schemes  and the  reliability of  the
  annotation, ii) crowdsourcing annotation, potentially supporting the
  annotation  of some  aspects  for  larger data  sets,  and iii)  the
  automatic labelling using computational approaches.

- project descriptions and progress reports for research focused on or
  integrating discourse annotation

- tools  that   support  discourse  annotation  concepts   and  goals,
  including   conceptual   explorations   of  wish   lists   or   tool
  specifications

- research speaking to the gap between qualitative linguistic analysis
  and empirically broad analysis of ecologically valid data

While  the  presentation  language  at the  workshop  is  English,  we
encourage research on a broad range of languages.

Submission  are submitted  electronically  using EasyChair:

         https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=discann2020

Reviewing will be double blind, so obvious self-references should be
avoided and acknowledgements should not be included.  We will
electronically publish proceedings with the accepted, final versions
of the papers (in a form with a permanent URN making it citable).
